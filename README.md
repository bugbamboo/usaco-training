# usaco-training

Hi! This is the compliation of all of my USACO solutions so far. These are just sample code with no explanations. These problems range from a couple bronze to mostly silver + gold. These are taken from past contests, along with the USACO Training Page. Currently, I write in Java, but I plan to switch to C++ soon.
